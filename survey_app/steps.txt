# Step-by-Step Instructions to Build Survey Application - Functionality Focus

## Step 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
1. Create a basic folder structure for the MERN stack application:
   - A `client` folder for the React frontend.
   - A `server` folder for the Node.js and Express backend.
2. Set up a basic Express server in the backend:
   - Create an entry file (e.g., `index.js`) to start the server.
   - Define a simple API route (e.g., `/api`) to test the backend.
3. Set up a basic React frontend:
   - Replace the default content of `App.js` with a simple "Hello World" message.
   - Ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend.

## Step 2: User Registration and Authentication
1. Implement user registration:
   - Create a `User` model in MongoDB to store user details (email, password, income range, location, job type).
   - Add a registration form in the React frontend to collect user details.
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/register`) to save user data to the database.
2. Implement user login:
   - Add a login form in the React frontend.
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/login`) to authenticate users and generate a JWT token.
3. Add authentication middleware:
   - Create a middleware function to verify the JWT token for protected routes.

## Step 3: User Profile Management
1. Fetch user profile data:
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/profile`) to fetch the logged-in user's profile data.
   - Display the profile data in the React frontend.
2. Update user profile data:
   - Add a form in the React frontend to update user details (income range, location, job type).
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/profile`) to update the user's profile data in the database.

## Step 4: Survey Creation
1. Create a `Survey` model in MongoDB:
   - Include fields like `title`, `description`, `tags`, `point_value`, `participant_limit`, and `host_id`.
2. Add a survey creation form in the React frontend:
   - Allow hosts to input survey details (title, description, questions, etc.).
3. Implement AI-powered tag suggestions:
   - Use an AI API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to analyze the survey title and description.
   - Display suggested tags in the survey creation form.
4. Create a backend API route (`/api/surveys`) to save the survey data to the database.

## Step 5: Survey Participation
1. Fetch available surveys:
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/surveys`) to fetch a list of surveys.
   - Display the surveys in the React frontend with filters (e.g., tags, points, demographics).
2. Add a survey response form:
   - Allow participants to answer survey questions.
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/responses`) to save responses to the database.
3. Credit points to participants:
   - Update the participant's points in the database upon survey completion.

## Step 6: Points and Redemption
1. Fetch user points:
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/points`) to fetch the logged-in user's total points.
   - Display the points in the React frontend.
2. Implement point redemption:
   - Add a redemption request feature in the React frontend.
   - Create a backend API route (`/api/redeem`) to handle redemption requests and notify the host for payment.

## Step 7: QR Code Generation
1. Add QR code generation for surveys:
   - Use a QR code library in the React frontend to generate QR codes for surveys.
   - Display the QR code in the survey details page.
   - Allow hosts to download or print the QR code for physical distribution.

## Step 8: Admin Dashboard
1. Create an `Admin` model in MongoDB:
   - Include fields like `email` and `password`.
2. Add admin-specific routes:
   - Create routes to fetch all users, surveys, and transactions.
   - Restrict access to these routes to admin users only.
3. Build an admin dashboard in the React frontend:
   - Display statistics and manage users, surveys, and transactions.

## Step 9: Testing and Debugging
1. Test all API routes and frontend components:
   - Ensure proper functionality for user registration, login, survey creation, participation, and redemption.
2. Debug any issues in the frontend and backend.
3. Optimize the application for performance and security.

## Step 10: Final Touches
1. Add error handling and validation:
   - Ensure all forms and API routes have proper validation and error messages.
2. Improve the UI/UX of the React frontend:
   - Use a modern design library (e.g., Material-UI or Tailwind CSS) to enhance the user interface.
3. Write documentation for the application:
   - Document the API routes, features, and how to use the application.
